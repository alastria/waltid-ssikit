# Introduction

The __SSI Kit__ is a technology stack for enabling Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in any application. All components are written in Kotlin/Java and can directly be tied in JVM-based
applications. Alternatively all functions can be accesses over the RESTfull webservice interface, making integration with other languages and deployment scenarios straigtforward.
